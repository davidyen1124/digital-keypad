The "Not PearAI's" License

Copyright (c) 2024 Definitely Not [PearAI](https://totally-original-ideas.com)

Hey there! Thanks for checking out this totally original software that we definitely
didn't just fork from someone else's repo. We're granting you permission to use this
software that we _ahem_ "created", as long as you follow these super serious conditions:

1. Don't be like PearAI - Actually write your own code sometimes
2. If you fork this repo, at least change the variable names or something
3. When presenting at conferences, try to remember which parts you actually wrote

This software comes with absolutely no warranty, just like PearAI's claims of originality.
We're not responsible if this code breaks, causes your computer to explode, or makes
you look as silly as a company that just copies other people's work.

IN CASE IT WASN'T CLEAR: This is a parody license poking fun at companies that
fork repositories without adding any real value. Any resemblance to actual companies
that rhyme with "BearAI" is purely intentional... I mean, coincidental.

P.S. If you're reading this, PearAI's legal team - yes, this is satire. Look it up.
